# React Native with V8 Runtime

The aim of this project is to support V8 runtime for React Native. Designed as opt-in package, it should easy to integrate with existing React Native projects.

## Integration with React Native

To make RN integration easier, we publish prebuilt AAR into [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-v8).

The versioning is aligned with React Native but suffixed with a `-patch.N` in version
E.g.
If your React Native version is `0.60.0`, you should use react-native-v8 `>=0.60.0-patch.0 <0.60.1`.

Following steps will take 0.60.0 as example.

1. Install react-native-v8

```sh
yarn add 'react-native-v8@>=0.60.0-patch.0 <0.60.1'

# [OPTIONAL] If to use different V8 version
# yarn add 'v8-android@7.5.0'
```

2. Modify your React Native build.gradle

```

3. Gradle rebuild or `react-native run-android`

4. Start application and could verify by JS `global._v8runtime().version` which expected to return V8 version.

## Builtin JavaScript object

`global._v8runtime()` has some builtin information such as v8 version.

```js
console.log(`V8 version is ${global._v8runtime().version}`);
```

## V8 Features Flags
V8 provides many feature flags and the most important one should be JIT.
Currently JIT is disabled except on arm64-v8a.

react-native-v8 use the V8 shared libray from [v8-android-buildscripts](https://github.com/Kudo/v8-android-buildscripts).
For detailed V8 features, please check [there](https://github.com/Kudo/v8-android-buildscripts/blob/master/README.md#v8-feature-flags).

## TODO

- [x] Performance comparison with JavaScriptCore in React Native

  Please check https://github.com/Kudo/react-native-js-benchmark for the benchmark and result
      
- [ ] V8 inspector integration
- [ ] V8 snapshot integration
- [ ] V8 code cache experiment
